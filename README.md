Next.js 13 has introduced the app router. App Router organizes routes within the app folder. The file-based App router follows slightly different conventions while creating routes. Checkout the [medium blog]() to know more about routing in app router.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
